Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 Challenge Tracker! This repository serves as a record of my attempts and solutions for the Advent of Code coding challenges for the year 2023.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new coding challenge is released, featuring problems that cover a variety of algorithms and data structures. It's a great opportunity to improve coding skills, learn new techniques, and have fun with programming.

## How to Run the Code

For each day and part, you can find a `solution.js` file. To run the code, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the specific day and part folder, e.g., `Day1/Part1`.
2. Open a terminal in that folder.
3. Run the NodeJS script using a command like `node solution.js`.

Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine.
